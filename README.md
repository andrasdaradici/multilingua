# Features
- Custom scriptable objects called "Language Items" for every language which include the following properties:
  - Name of language.
  - Font of language. (Japanese, Hindi, Urdu, etc. may use different fonts.)
  - Path to the language file. (You do not have to add the extension of the file, just enter the path and the script will do the rest for you)
  - Ability to choose between XML and JSON format.

- Check if the file path inside the Language Item is valid or not and if the provided keys are valid or not. (They only show up in the inspector when you run the project, it also works for the JSON format if I'd images for those also there'd be too many of them.)

- Automatically add Language Items whenever you are in play mode
- Language gets stored in the PlayerPrefs under the "CurrentLanguage" as an integer so you do not have to worry about saving the language.

**Step 3:** - Locate the "MultiLingua" and "Plugins" folder and drag them into the "Assets" folder of your project
Note: Do NOT remove the Plugins folder as this will break the whole code, the code uses JSON.NET to read the data from `.json` files.
